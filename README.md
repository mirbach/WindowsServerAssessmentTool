## Code signing and packaging

- Sign scripts with your code-signing cert:
   - Configure a certificate: either import a PFX to CurrentUser\My or provide `-PfxPath` when running the tool.
   - From VS Code: run task "Sign: Sign scripts (Thumbprint)" and replace `[YOUR_CERT_THUMBPRINT]` in `.vscode/tasks.json`.
   - Or run manually:
      - pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\Sign-Code.ps1 -Thumbprint [THUMBPRINT] -Path . -Recurse -SkipValid

- Verify signatures:
   - From VS Code: run task "Sign: Verify scripts".
   - Or run manually:
      - pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\Sign-Code.ps1 -VerifyOnly -Path . -Recurse

- Build an .exe with PS2EXE (optional):
   - From VS Code: run task "Build: UI EXE (PS2EXE)" to produce `dist/WSAT-UI.exe`.
   - Or run manually:
      - pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\Build-Exe.ps1 -InputPath .\WindowsServerAssessmentTool_UI.ps1 -Output .\dist\WSAT-UI.exe -NoConsole -Sta

Notes:

- Requires Windows PowerShell 5.1+.
- PS2EXE is installed from PSGallery if missing.
- Signing uses SHA256 and timestamps via DigiCert by default.

## Troubleshooting

### HTML Report Navigation Issues

1. **Navigation Menu Not Responding**
   - **Solution:** Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
   - **Alternative:** Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

2. **Sections Not Expanding/Collapsing**
   - **Cause:** JavaScript execution blocked or browser compatibility
   - **Solution:** Check browser console for errors, use updated browser

3. **Layout Corruption in Specific Sections**
   - **Symptoms:** Content overlapping or misaligned
   - **Solution:** Refresh the page, ensure browser zoom is at 100%

4. **Tables Not Displaying Properly**
   - **Symptoms:** Wide tables overflowing or headers misaligned
   - **Solution:** Ensure browser supports CSS flexbox and CSS3 features
   - **Alternative:** Use horizontal scroll within table containers

5. **Dynamic Content Not Updating**
   - **Cause:** Report sections not reflecting selected assessment mode
   - **Solution:** Re-run the script if content doesn't match your selection
   - **Check:** Verify the correct menu option was selected during execution

6. **Print Layout Issues**
   - **Cause:** Print-specific CSS not loading properly
   - **Solution:** Use browser's print preview and adjust print settings

### Performance Tips

- Use specific assessment modes for faster execution
- Ensure sufficient disk space in the output directory
- Close unnecessary applications to free up system resources
- Run during off-peak hours for comprehensive assessments

### Common Script Issues

1. **Permission Denied Errors**
   - **Solution:** Run PowerShell as Administrator
   - **Alternative:** Check file/folder permissions on output directory

2. **Execution Policy Restrictions**
   - **Error:** "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled"
   - **Solution:** `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

3. **WMI Access Issues**
   - **Symptoms:** Missing system information or errors during assessment
   - **Solution:** Ensure WMI service is running: `Get-Service Winmgmt`

4. **Network Information Missing**
   - **Cause:** Insufficient privileges or network adapter issues
   - **Solution:** Verify network adapters are properly configured and accessible

5. **Long Execution Times**
   - **Expected Behavior:** Complete server assessments can take several minutes
   - **Optimization:** Use specific assessment modes (1-4) instead of "ALL SECTIONS" for faster execution

## Security Considerations

### Data Sensitivity
The script collects various types of sensitive information:

- **System Configuration:** Hardware and software details
- **Security Settings:** Firewall rules, antivirus status, user accounts
- **Network Information:** IP configurations, open ports, traffic statistics
- **Event Logs:** System events, security events, application logs

### Best Practices

1. **Secure Storage:** Store assessment output files in secure locations
2. **Access Control:** Limit access to generated assessment reports
3. **Data Retention:** Implement appropriate data retention policies
4. **Regular Cleanup:** Remove old assessment reports that are no longer needed
5. **Network Security:** Be cautious when transmitting reports over networks

### Customization Options

### Modifying Assessment Scope
To customize what information is assessed:

1. Edit the respective `Get-*Information` functions
2. Add or remove specific data collection commands
3. Modify the CSV export sections as needed

### Changing Output Formats

- **HTML Styling:** Modify the CSS section in the HTML generation area
- **CSV Structure:** Adjust the `Select-Object` statements in collection functions
- **Additional Formats:** Add JSON or XML export options if needed

### Adding New Assessments

1. Create new collection logic within existing functions
2. Add corresponding CSV export paths
3. Update HTML generation sections
4. Test thoroughly with different system configurations
